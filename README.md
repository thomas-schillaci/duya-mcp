# MCP Server built with mcp-use

This is an MCP server project bootstrapped with [`create-mcp-use-app`](https://mcp-use.com/docs/typescript/getting-started/quickstart).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/inspector](http://localhost:3000/inspector) with your browser to test your server.

You can start building by editing the entry file. Add tools, resources, and prompts — the server auto-reloads as you edit.
